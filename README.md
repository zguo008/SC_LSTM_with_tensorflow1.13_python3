# SC_LSTM_with_tensorflow1.13_python3

An implementation of SC_LSTM_with_tensorflow1.13_python3 This repo is an improvement of [this implementation](https://github.com/hit-computer/SC-LSTM). This repo also shows a way to prepare a parallel dataset using gensim. 
## Preparing dataset
NTU_DATA/create_word_embedding/preprocess_csv.py and create_embedding.py<br />

## Getting Started

To train: change the training config at Config.py; python train_test.py
 
### Prerequisites

Tensorflow 1.13 and above; python 3.7

## Running the tests
./generate.sh
